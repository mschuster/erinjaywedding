	Jenna and Erin have also known OF each other since they were both in Elementary school. Erin was in the same grade as Jenna’s older brother, and therefore went to school with Jenna as well, starting back in Elementary! Jenna and Erin also ran the House Sitting Business together upon Erin’s return from New Zealand from 2008 until 2010.  They remained friends and confidants through the ups and downs of life ever since.
