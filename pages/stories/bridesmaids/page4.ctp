	Jennifer Stevens, aka Jennifer Schuster is the other Matron of Honor for the same reason as above. Jennifer and Erin were almost inseparable throughout grade school, where many a sleep over, book writing session, and shenanigans at recess ensued. Part of Erinâ€™s life, and continuously so, Jennifer certainly holds the title of honor!
