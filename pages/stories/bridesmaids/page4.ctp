	Jennifer Stevens is also a Matron of Honor as Erin has known Jennifer for as long as she can remember. Jennifer and Erin were almost inseparable throughout grade school, where many a sleep over, book writing session, and shenanigans at recess ensued. All the way through grade school, and even through University, Erin and Jennifer have stayed friends!
