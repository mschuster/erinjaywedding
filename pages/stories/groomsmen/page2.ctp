	Alexander is a generous, thoughtful, and talented 10 year old – Jason’s only son, and the Best Boy anyone could ask for! He will be finishing grade 5 this year, and looking forward to a summer full of boat rides on Chestermere lake, lots of swimming, and the most important wedding of his young life!!
