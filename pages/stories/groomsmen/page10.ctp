	Adam is Erin’s brother, and is looking forward to gaining a brother of his own! A recent graduate of the Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Calgary, he has recently been working for Manitok Energy  - an oil and gas exploration and production company.  Adam also enjoys skiing, and working on his car – both similar hobbies to his soon to be brother-in-law!
